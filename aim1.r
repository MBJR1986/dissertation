#Aim 1: which personal factor indepedently influence concussion treatment time?
  #a. assess the amount of time between the injury event and the date of evaluation 
  #   to determine if there is a significant portion of time between injury date and evaluation date.
  #b. explore clinical notes from each personâ€™s last clinical visit to investigate the assumption that
  #   a person is no longer clinically followed because they have returned to their previous levels of functioning.


# Population: All individuals seen at the KUMC Concussion Clinic between the dates of January 1, 2011 and Aug 1, 2017?
#   This analysis will only include individuals with TEXT NOTES, as the manual chart reviews of these individuals is necessary
#   for the completion of this aim.

# summary: For aim 1.a, I wanted to look at the difference in injury date vs. eval date. On average, nearly 18 days passed 
# between injury date and evaluation date. This data was skewed to outliers on the high end, as the median was 6 days wait. 
# Range = 0 days to 132 days. That being said, I think it would be the best choice to use the date of evaluation, as opposed to 
# injury date for the work moving forward, as this event is clearly documented and referenced. I was able to verify the injury date in 
# roughly 1/3rd of the encounters at the concussion clinic.
